In this directory is a summary of _Go it Alone_, by Bruce Judson. I wanted to show what Cliff Notes, on Steroids, for Business would look like, for a possible small venture. 

The summary is meant to be the fastest way to absorb a business book. Note in particular the concept map, crossword puzzle, and detailed cross reference pages in the back of the summary.
