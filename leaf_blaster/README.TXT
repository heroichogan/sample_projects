Documentation for my LeafBlaster game, written in GameMaker. The idea is to blow your leaves into the neighbor's yard (topical). I like this project because it introduced me to particle simulation (for the leaves) and Blender; also, because it was a high-leverage tool. Sadly, I think the game files are on a damaged disk. 

Tools used: GameMaker, Blender, Poser, photo editor.
